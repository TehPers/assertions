//! Modifiers used for asynchronous tests.
//!
//! This module contains types used primarily for testing asynchronous code. The
//! assertions created from the modifiers in this module are generally
//! asynchronous and need to be `.await`ed in order for them to execute.
//!
//! This module also contains types that can be useful for writing your own
//! asynchronous assertions and modifiers, if needed.
